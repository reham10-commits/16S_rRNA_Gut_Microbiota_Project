# Gut Microbiota Dynamics in Response to Bile Duct Ligation and FK10 Intervention

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores the impact of **bile duct ligation (BDL)** and **probiotic FK10** treatment on gut microbiota composition and diversity using **16S rRNA sequencing**.  
The study evaluates microbial community responses, focusing on the abundance of **Prevotellaceae** and overall ecological resilience over a 14-day period in murine models.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Assess gut microbial composition under **normal (sham)** and **BDL-induced cholestasis** conditions.  
- Examine the effect of **FK10 intervention** on microbial stability.  
- Monitor the **abundance of Prevotellaceae** and diversity metrics over time.  
- Visualize **alpha** and **beta diversity** changes using QIIME 2 plugins.  
- Statistically compare microbial metrics across experimental groups and time points.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Data Processing (QIIME 2 Pipeline)
- Imported raw sequence reads.  
- Demultiplexed and trimmed adapters/low-quality bases.  
- Denoised and chimera-filtered with **DADA2** to obtain ASVs.  
- Taxonomic classification using a pre-trained **NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier** and the **Greengenes** database.  

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- **Alpha Diversity:** Shannon Entropy, Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity.  
- **Beta Diversity:** Jaccard & Brayâ€“Curtis indices with PCoA visualization.  
- **Statistical Tests:**  
  - One-way ANOVA + Tukeyâ€™s post hoc.  
  - Repeated measures ANOVA for within-group changes.  
- **Significance threshold:** p < 0.05.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Prevotellaceae Resilience:** Relative abundance remained stable or increased across all groups, even under BDL conditions.  
- **Alpha Diversity:** Increased in BDL and FK10_BDL groups, indicating **adaptation rather than dysbiosis**.  
- **Beta Diversity:** No strong clustering observed â†’ overlapping microbial structures despite taxonomic shifts.  
- **Effect of FK10:** Subtly modulated microbiota composition but did not prevent BDL-induced changes.  
- **Limitation:** Relative abundance metrics used; absolute quantification (e.g., qPCR) is recommended.
